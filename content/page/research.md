My research interests are broad. My recent works are about **occultation and variable stars observation and data analysis**. I am developing a python code to reduce and analyze lunar occultation's light curves (and also other types of occulation e.g. asteroid occultation and planetary occultation). I also involve in exoplanet research project at Bosscha Observatory, Institut Teknologi Bandung, ID, as data analysis coordinator.  You could see my assorted recent publications in this <a href="https://bosscha.itb.ac.id/#publications" target="_blank">link</a>.
