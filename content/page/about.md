My name is Agus Triono Puri Jatmiko. Quite mouthful, eh? but you can call me **PJ** for short. I have things that I love most:

- _This_ Universe
- Whichever Universes with Piano, Photography, and Python-thingy in them
- My little fam!

What else do you need?

#### my story?

To be honest, I'm just nobody. Only a puny human who want to know the mysteries of the Universe and really like to learn something new. Love to chat, but hate to write (_duh!_). I'm trying my best.

**That's all, folks**.
